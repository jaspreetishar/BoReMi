## Quick Start Guide: Setting up BoReMi on a Cluster or a Local Environment

To facilitate the setup of BoReMi on a cluster or local machine, two notebooks are provided as part of its setup in the "BoReMi" directory. One of the notebooks serves as a graphical user interface (GUI.ipynb), while the other contains all the necessary functions (Functions.ipynb). To ensure a seamless setup process, users should ensure that they have installed the required packages/modules mentioned in the 'requirements.txt' file on the main page of the repository. Users can acquire the notebooks by either downloading them directly or using the 'git clone https://github.com/jaspreetishar/BoReMi.git' command to extract them onto their local machine/cluster. Once the notebooks are obtained, the user should access the notebook that contains the GUI. By following these guidelines and the instructions further provided inside of GUI.ipynb, users can easily set up BoReMi on their cluster or local machine and begin using the tool and explore its functionalities.
